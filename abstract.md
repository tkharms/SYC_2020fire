In 2020 the Bush Fire burned approximately half of the Sycamore Creek watershed in central Arizona. Sycamore Creek has been subject to >40 years of research and the stream has been monitored by NEON since 2017. We studied the effects of fire on biogeochemistry of the stream and its watershed. We deployed autosamplers to monitor stream chemistry during storms on the mainstem and in ephemeral tributaries draining burned and unburned watersheds. The storm sampling program commenced nearly a year following the fire because absence of summer monsoon or winter storms in 2020-21 resulted in no flow in tributaries and intermittent flow in the mainstem. Water chemistry was measured during 14 monsoon storms of 2021 and winter frontal storms of 2021-22 with samples of baseflow collected in the mainstem during intervening periods. Water samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and major anions and cations. We also measured nutrient content of ash and chemistry of ash leachate as a potential source of solutes to stream biota.
