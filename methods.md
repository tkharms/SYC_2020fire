## ash

We measured the chemistry of ash collected from the Sycamore Creek watershed. Ash was collected manually at varying distances from stream channels. Total carbon and nitrogen were measured on a Perkin-Elmer elemental analyzer. We measured leachable concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus and major anions and cations using the analytical methods described for stream water samples. Leachates were prepared by shaking 1 mg of ash in 50 mL of ultrapure water. Leachates were filtered through 0.7 μm glass fiber filters prior to analysis. We measured lability of dissolved organic carbon in leachates as change in concentration following 21 days of incubation. Water was filtered to 0.2 μm and a microbial inoculum was added. Samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature.

## stream chemistry

Water was collected by autosamplers during storms and manually during baseflow. Grab samples were filtered upon collection and samples collected by autosamplers were retrieved within 24 h and filtered in the laboratory (maximum pore size 0.7 μm, glass fiber filters). Water was then frozen until analysis. Samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen via non-dispersive infrared gas analysis and chemiluminescence, respectively, on a Shimadzu TOC/TN-L. Concentrations of major anions and cations were analyzed via ion chromatography on a Thermo ion chromatograph with AS-11 columns for anions and CS-16 columns for cations. Soluble reactive phosphorus was measured colorimetrically using the molybdate method on a Lachat autoanalyzer and total dissolved phosphorus was measured by the same method following acid-persulfate digestion. Ammonium was measured colorimetrically on a subset of samples using the phenol hypochlorite method using a Lachat autoanalyzer, and was additionally measured by ion chromatography. For all analyses, measured concentrations less than the lowest value used in calibration were replaced with half of the limit of quantitation for each analyte (shown below).
